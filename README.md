# Russ Gunther

I've been a full stack web developer for over 10 years now and have primarily worked with Python/Django and a variety
of different Javascript frameworks. What you'll find here
is primarily projects of me learning things outside of web dev to keep things fresh for me.

Things I'm curious about outside of my normal day-to-day:
- Compilers and Interpreters
- CLI tools
- Building a text editor
- Graphics proramming
